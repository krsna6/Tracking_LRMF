# tracking_LRMF
Tracking objects at a shot level using Low Rank Matrix Factorization for FG/BG modeling

TO-DO  - document the following attempts
1) Describe frame-difference based motion tracking
2) Describe Low-rank Matrix Factorization (LRMF) to do Foreground/Background modeling and initialize bounding box to track (use camshift to improve init boxes)
3) Us CMT (https://github.com/gnebehay/CMT) for tracking
